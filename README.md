# fec-data
scripted analysis of FEC election data for use in data visualization

### How to use
If you have an R environment either on the command line or using rStudio, you can simply download and run this script to generate the same files that I'm using to visualize FEC data in my blog post at [austinczarnecki.com](austinczarnecki.com).
